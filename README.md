Whack-a-Patwary-
Just Mirza abbas and Patwary being themselves 🐸

🎮 How to Play
The Targets
Patwary: The main source of noise. Whack him for +10 points.
The Clock: Time is running out! Whack the clock icon to add +2 seconds to the session.
The Handshake: BEWARE. A shady handshake will cost you -50 points and reset your Accountability Meter to zero.
The Accountability Wave
Precision matters. If you hit 35 Patwarys in a row without hitting a handshake, you trigger the Accountability Wave.

The screen will flash gold.
All 16 holes will fill with Patwarys.
Each hit during the wave is worth 100 points.
